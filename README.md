# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
This weather dashboard's purpose is to pull information from the weather API and display the information in an organized fashion. The user is able to enter in a city name, and click search which will display the current weather for that city, and a 5-day forecast for that same city below. The search history is saved in local storage and displayed under the search bar. Users are able to click on a city in the search history and it will display the data for the desired city. The user is then able to clear the search history and begin again by searching for a new city.
